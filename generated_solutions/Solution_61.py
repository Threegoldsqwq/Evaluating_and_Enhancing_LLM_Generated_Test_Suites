def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    Given a string of "(" and ")", determine if every opening bracket has a
    corresponding closing bracket and they are correctly nested.

    Args:
        brackets: A string consisting only of '(' and ')' characters.

    Returns:
        True if the bracketing is correct, False otherwise.

    Examples:
        >>> correct_bracketing("(")
        False
        >>> correct_bracketing("()")
        True
        >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")

def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list[int]) -> bool:

    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
        it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
        sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    This solution uses three nested loops to check all possible combinations
    of three distinct elements.

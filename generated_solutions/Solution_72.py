def will_it_fly(q: list, w: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if an object q will fly based on its balance and weight.

    The object q will fly if:
    1. It's balanced (a palindromic list).
    2. The sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w.

    Args:
        q: A list of numbers representing the object's elements.
        w: An integer representing the maximum possible weight the object can have to fly.

    Returns:
        True if the object q will fly, False otherwise.

    Examples:
    will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) ➞ False
    # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.

    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) ➞ False
    # It's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.

    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) ➞ True
    # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.

    will_it_fly([3], 5) ➞ True
    # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.

    # Condition 1: Check if the list q is palindromic
    # A list is palindromic if it is equal to its reversed version.

    # Condition 2: Check if the sum of elements is less than or equal to w
    # Use sum() to calculate the total weight of the object.

    is_light_enough = (total_weight <= w)
